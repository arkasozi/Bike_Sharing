From this data, we can determine the number of bicycles that are required, to be succesful, when we can do maintenance of the bicycles, which stations will be busy dependent on factors like tourism, work, weather and so make sure that we have sufficient bicycles at thses stations

We can also look into creating different drop points from where the bicycles are picked up and this would be a benefit to our customers.

from the gender data, we can determine the size and type of bicyles that we are required to satisfy the customers in terms of size

# Conclusion

This would be a very good venture to roll out, but would require to determine the weather and population of desmont to be able to accurately determine the bicycle numbers and what locations we should place them
